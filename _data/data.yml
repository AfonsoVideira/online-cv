career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My passion for science ignited early,
      sparked by childhood curiosity about dinosaurs,
      leading me to explore diverse scientific subjects from biology to physics through books and online research.
      I started my academical studies on Electrical Engineering at FEUP initially, but later transitioned to Biology
      for my bachelor's degree, drawn by the allure of the life sciences. Soon enough, just like bugs crawl into code &#128030;,
      coding crawled back into my life, leading me to pursue a Master's in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

      Soon after concluding my master thesis I've joined Mitotag where I managed their experimental data and develop tools to
      perform data analysis and visualization. Wanted to grow even further as a professional software developer, 
      but not wanting to leave the biotech field, I found that Amyris was the place I wanted to be and joined as a developer.
      Withing a big software team at Amyris I've helped build in-house software solutions
      tailored for the Research and Development (R&D) department. As my software knowledge grew so did my new focus within the company,
      and I've transition to a DevOps role, where I help optimize development, testing, and production environments and manage infrastructure.
